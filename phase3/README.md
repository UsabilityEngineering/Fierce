# Team Fierce, Phase 3: Usability Evaluation

Phase 3's focus was to take everything we've learned and put it into our prototype, and then build a moderator protocol to have a user go through a moderated process of performing tasks. The goal is that this moderated session would demonstrate how someone within a defined profile based on the data collected in Phase 1 would use our intended product, but as a prototype. We hope that while the moderated session is successful, that we can gain valuable data in how the product is actually used. If our goal is to create a streamlined and convenient middle platform for event registration, we need to make sure that the users we are targeting (at a minimum) can navigate the software as intended.

# Task Explanations

### Protocol Task 1: Effectiveness
> If the tool adds time to the experience, then improvements will be required. Should the tool improve the user's ability to organize events or save time organizing events, then additional tasks may be developed to quantify these benefits. One of the primary purposes of Event Finder is to collectively add all known fitness and sports events to make the experience easier and located in one place for competitors/attendees. This task will be very important to test and evaluate the user's ability to save time and effectiveness of the application.

> What we hope to discover from this is to assess the effectiveness of the Event Finder's ability to improve organization. As one of the primary goals of Event Finder is to combine multiple sources of events into one easy to lookup location, it's important to improve the usability of the application.

### Protocol Task 2: Error Tolerance
> In addition to testing the effectiveness and learnability of the software, it is important that the software is also error tolerant. As we're trying to simplify the process of obtaining admission, we want to evaluate the software's ability to handle mistakes made by the user, or make corrections/assumptions where needed.

> What we hope to discover from this task is to assess the error tolerance of the software by either guiding the user to the correct solution or correctly handling what the user was intending to do.

# The Approach

> The approach to this study is both a formative assessment as well as experimental. First, we want to test the software by having the user find ways for us to make the software more effective at solving the problem of slow registration processes and having to go across multiple services to acquire admission to events. Second, we want to have the user experiment with it, to find ways the software can be improved to better serve the aforementioned purpose and to find ways the software could be more beneficial than we expect it to be.
