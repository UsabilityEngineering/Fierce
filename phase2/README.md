# Phase II: User-Centered Design

We're fixing this because we screwed up the phases.

# Registration Confirmation

This is the page you arrive to after registration. We want the registration process to be quick, easy and painless. One of the important aspects of registration is confirmation, as we want users to know they successfully registered. As our project is intended to make obtaining admission for key/multiple events easy, we need the software to be error tolerant.

This is the landing page. To make the application *effective* in terms of solving the issue, the homepage is also the event selection page. Users will scroll through all known events listed by distance and date, to find events that interest them.

Once an event has been selected, the event information window on the right half of the screen will display detailed event information as well as attempt to obtain a google map view of the area the event is hosted in. This allows users to research information on their event without more than scrolling and a click.

More than one event can be selected, however to avoid exponential amounts of repetitive wireframe setups, our wireframe model only depicts being able to register for one event at a time. This way, we only had to write 9 different slides. If we demonstrated the ability to register for multiple events, we would have had to have 23,410 slides. Long story short, the depiction only shows single event registration. Once an event is selected, the sign up button becomes available. This stores the event into the cart, without the viewer having to go to registration, so they can continue to scroll the events list and stock up on events they want to know more about.

Once the user has selected their events, clicking on View Cart gives them a view of all the events they've selected (albeit shortened). They can then modify their cart based on which events they really want to attend, and then proceed to the checkout.

For the sake of the timewindow of this project, we plan to launch using an external eCommerce source, or open up various links so the user can go to each event host's website to register for the event. The website would keep track of each registration to ensure the user seamlessly can register for their events.
