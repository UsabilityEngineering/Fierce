# Fierce Event Finder (FEF)

Today users face numerous difficulties in attending events, from the ticket acquisition to the event attendance or lack thereof. In order to determine bottlenecks and user desires, a standardized questionairre is used to collect data regarding these steps. With data gathered, it will be analyzed to define responses in terms of personas and scenarios in order to generate potential solutions to user obstacles. These solutions can then be applied to existing and theoretical data to determine their likelihood of success. If a solution seems to be likely to succeed it can be implemented in the Fierce Event Finder, where users will have a summary of any and all information necessary to attending events.

## Phase 1: User Inquiry and Inspection

### Executive Summary
* Successfully gathered mock data based on unique personas through the use of Google Forms Online Survey.
* Practiced proper communication across all group members to ensure work meets expecations and is completed correctly/on time.
* Analyzed raw data and successfully converted into useful information with the use of a pivot table to draw proper conclusions.
* Worked as a team to build out and complete a clean report containing all necessary information based on our findings and conclusion.

### Data Gathered
* The majority of users use Family/Friends to locate events, with Internet Searches being the second most preferred.
* Users who are notified of event cancellation without resorting to phone calls average 50% higher event attendance.
* Notifying users via phone did not have a noticable impact on event attendance.
* Most users acquired tickets/passes in around five minutes.
* Nearly one-third of respondants had not attended events in the last thirty days, but responded anyway.
* The Veterans were the majority Persona of event attendances, followed by The Curious, and then The Free Spirits.
* The Detectives were the majority Sub-Persona of event attendances, followed by The Forgiving, and then The Sheriffs.
* The Detectives and The Curious made up over half of user Personas.
* The Detectives, The Forgiving, and The Ghosted make up over half of user Sub-Personas.
* All Personas and Sub-Personas averaged between one and three events, except The Curious that attended zero.

### Important Outcomes
The average user spends 5 or more minutes to purchase a single event registration ticket.
> * Registration should be taken into further account by developing a quick and simple registration process, making the overall user experience much more enjoyable.

The majority of users found events of interest by searching for them through the use of the internet or through family/friends.
> * It would be useful to obtain further data by analyzing these existing software/registration processes by attending these events or contracting with the event hosts directly.

Nearly 1/3 of all users that completed the survey had not attended a fitness event within the last 30 days.
> * To improve accuracy in our data through the use of an online survey/questionairre, it would be useful to send emails to eligible participants directly after a popular local event has ended, requesting that they fill out our survey in a timely manner.
