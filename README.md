# Fierce Event Finder (FEF)

Today users face numerous difficulties in attending events, from the ticket acquisition to the event attendance or lack thereof. In order to determine bottlenecks and user desires, a standardized questionairre is used to collect data regarding these steps. With data gathered, it will be analyzed to define responses in terms of personas and scenarios in order to generate potential solutions to user obstacles. These solutions can then be applied to existing and theoretical data to determine their likelihood of success. If a solution seems to be likely to succeed it can be implemented in the Fierce Event Finder, where users will have a summary of any and all information necessary to attending events.
