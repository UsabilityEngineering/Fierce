# Fierce Event Finder (FEF)

Today users face numerous difficulties in attending events, from the ticket acquisition to the event attendance or lack thereof. In order to determine bottlenecks and user desires, a standardized questionairre is used to collect data regarding these steps. With data gathered, it will be analyzed to define responses in terms of personas and scenarios in order to generate potential solutions to user obstacles. These solutions can then be applied to existing and theoretical data to determine their likelihood of success. If a solution seems to be likely to succeed it can be implemented in the Fierce Event Finder, where users will have a summary of any and all information necessary to attending events.

## Team Members

* Kira Casto - Wrote introduction, developed pivot table for data analysis, collected and analyzed findings, defined personas and sub-personas, and contributed method details.
* Michael Harris - Wrote scenarios, worked on caveats and conclusion

## Phase 1: User Inquiry and Inspection

### Method Summary
* Executive Summary of methods,

### Data Gathered
* The majority of users use Family/Friends to locate events, with Internet Searches being the second most preferred.
* Users who are notified of event cancellation without resorting to phone calls average 50% higher event attendance.
* Notifying users via phone did not have a noticable impact on event attendance.
* Most users acquired tickets/passes in around five minutes.
* Nearly one-third of respondants had not attended events in the last thirty days, but responded anyway.
* The Veterans were the majority Persona of event attendances, followed by The Curious, and then The Free Spirits.
* The Detectives were the majority Sub-Persona of event attendances, followed by The Forgiving, and then The Sheriffs.
* The Detectives and The Curious made up over half of user Personas.
* The Detectives, The Forgiving, and The Ghosted make up over half of user Sub-Personas.
* All Personas and Sub-Personas averaged between one and three events, except The Curious that attended zero.
